Notes
-----
The inspiration for MailCircle came from the DashClock widget, which I'd relied upon for years to
give me an at-a-glance unread count on my lock screen. Unfortunately, with Android 5.x the ability
to put widgets on the lockscreen was removed, leaving me unread-count-less!

MailCircle was written for Android 5.x only (as those are the only devices I own), but it should be
relatively easy to reduce the minimum SDK level to cover Android 4.3 - I just haven't tried it.
